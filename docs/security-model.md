# Security Model

Fence is intended as **defense-in-depth** for running semi-trusted commands with reduced side effects (package installs, build scripts, CI jobs, unfamiliar repos).

It is **not** designed to be a strong isolation boundary against actively malicious code that is attempting to escape.

## Threat model (what Fence helps with)

Fence is useful when you want to reduce risk from:

- Supply-chain scripts that unexpectedly call out to the network
- Tools that write broadly across your filesystem
- Accidental leakage of secrets via "phone home" behavior
- Unfamiliar repos that run surprising commands during install/build/test

## What Fence enforces

### Network

- **Default deny**: outbound network is blocked unless explicitly allowed.
- **Allowlisting by domain**: you can specify `allowedDomains` (with wildcard support like `*.example.com`).
- **Localhost controls**: inbound binding and localhost outbound are separately controlled.

Important: domain filtering does **not** inspect content. If you allow a domain, code can exfiltrate via that domain.

#### How allowlisting works (important nuance)

Fence combines **OS-level enforcement** with **proxy-based allowlisting**:

- The OS sandbox / network namespace is expected to block **direct outbound** connections.
- Domain allowlisting happens via local HTTP/SOCKS proxies and proxy environment variables (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`).

If a program does not use proxy env vars (or uses a custom protocol/stack), it may **not benefit from domain allowlisting**. In that case it typically fails with connection errors rather than being "selectively allowed."

Localhost is separate from "external domains":

- `allowLocalOutbound=false` can intentionally block connections to local services like Redis on `127.0.0.1:6379` (see the dev-server example).

### Filesystem

- **Writes are denied by default**; you must opt in with `allowWrite`.
- **denyWrite** can block specific files/patterns even if the parent directory is writable.
- **denyRead** can block reads from sensitive paths.
- Fence includes an internal list of always-protected targets (e.g. shell configs, git hooks) to reduce common persistence vectors.

## Visibility / auditing

- `-m/--monitor` helps you discover what a command *tries* to access (blocked only).
- `-d/--debug` shows more detail to understand why something was blocked.

## Limitations (what Fence does NOT try to solve)

- **Hostile code containment**: assume determined attackers may escape via kernel/OS vulnerabilities.
- **Resource limits**: CPU, memory, disk, fork bombs, etc. are out of scope.
- **Content-based controls**: Fence does not block data exfiltration to *allowed* destinations.
- **Proxy limitations / protocol edge cases**: some programs may not respect proxy environment variables, so they won't get domain allowlisting unless you configure them to use a proxy (e.g. Node.js `http`/`https` without a proxy-aware client).

### Practical examples of proxy limitations

The proxy approach works well for many tools (curl, wget, git, npm, pip), but **not by default** for some stacks:

- Node.js native `http`/`https` (use a proxy-aware client, e.g. `undici` + `ProxyAgent`)
- Raw socket connections (custom TCP/UDP protocols)

Fence's OS-level sandbox is still expected to block direct outbound connections; bypassing the proxy should fail rather than silently succeeding.

### Domain-based filtering only

Fence does not inspect request content. If you allow a domain, a sandboxed process can still exfiltrate data to that domain.

### Not a hostile-code containment boundary

Fence is defense-in-depth for running semi-trusted code, not a strong isolation boundary against malware designed to escape sandboxes.
