Filesystem Sandbox Demo

This script demonstrates fence's filesystem controls:
- allowWrite: Only specific directories are writable
- denyWrite: Block writes to sensitive files
- denyRead: Block reads from sensitive paths

Run WITHOUT fence to see all operations succeed.
Run WITH fence to see unauthorized operations blocked.
